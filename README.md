# Object_Oriented

I watched a lot of videos on OOP. These are the four pilars of object oriented programming
Abstraction: Calling the method we use.
Inherentence: Transfering the data between classes.
Polymorphism: Changes the variable data to another class.
Encapsulation: Sets the variables for a certian class and not all of them.

Logo is an old programiming language that is used to draw things and create art.
It isn't used as much anymore and has been replaced for things like kid pix.
The cursor on the programming language is called turtle.
The turtle will follow directions typed in the terminal or input section.

It also taught some basic commands:
?Forward (Amount),
?Left (Amount),
?Right (Amount),
etc.

There was also a video about these group of people who made a turtle in real life that follows light but adjust when it touches something.
It is really cool.

### Doing Turtle in Real Life

In order to import turtle into python do this command line: "from turtle import *" or "import turtle"
but in replit you can just create a new project with turtle already installed so you don't have to install it
which is really nice and makes it easier.

Creating a turtle is like this:
[Name of Turtle you want] = turtle.Turtle()
My turtles are named bob, bop, bot, and tej :-)

The new commands are this:

[Name of Turtle].forward(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].left(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].right(Amount),
[Name of Turtle].beginfill(),
[Name of Turtle].endfill(),
[Name of Turtle].color("Name of Color")

these commands are really helpful in creating artwork and this is just the start. If you look through
the document of different commands there is so much you can actually do with turtle which is really cool.

### Using Turtle

I started out by playing around with different math functions and line lengths and colors.
I even created a really weird program that made the mouse go all over the place. It was really interesting.
Then I started playing around with circles and 360 degree shapes. What I came up with is called chainsaw in a box.
